You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes.<br /><br />This was one of Dreyfuss\\'s best roles, just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator! And the parting scene: like something out of Casablanca, indeed! <br /><br />Raul Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are homages to other films, like \"Round up the usual suspects!\" <br /><br />And Sonia Braga was excellent as the girl friend -- in addition to being a really hot number: \"You should get an Oscar for tonight!\" <br /><br />Let us not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.<br /><br />All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.<br /><br />-R.'"

The first is to use the low level functionality of SageMaker which requires knowing each of the objects involved in the SageMaker environment. The second is to use the high level functionality in which certain choices have been made on the user's behalf. The low level approach benefits from allowing the user a great deal of flexibility while the high level approach makes development much quicker. For our purposes we will opt to use the high level approach although using the low-level approach is certainly an option.\n",

What this method does is upload the data to the default bucket (which is created if it does not exist) into the path described by the key_prefix variable.

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples. An example of this in industry might be peforming an end of month report. This method of inference can also be useful to us as it means to can perform inference on our entire test set. \n",
